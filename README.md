# BWU2

BWU is a group of utilities for making a work with *BWMirror* and *BWAPI* more pretty. **It is not a substitute for any of BWAPI, BWMirror or JNIBWAPI.**

## Current state

I do not distribute this as a single artifact, so it is so far needed to be included in your project as a group of source codes. It also contains current *BWMirror* jar file.
